_A practical guide from someone on the ground in Yiwu_

I talk to a lot of small buyers from the US, Europe and Australia.  
Most of them discover 1688 very quickly:

> “Prices look amazing, but the whole site is in Chinese.  
> I don’t have RMB or Alipay. How do people actually buy from here?”

If that sounds like you, this article is for you. I’ll walk through:

- What 1688 really is (and what it is not)
    
- The four main obstacles you will hit as an overseas buyer
    
- The practical options you have **without** a Chinese bank account
    
- A simple step-by-step workflow I use when helping clients buy from 1688
    

I’ll keep it honest and simple, based on what I see every day in Yiwu.

## 1. What 1688 actually is

1688 is basically **Alibaba’s domestic wholesale platform** for the China market.

- Prices are usually lower than Alibaba.com because they are in RMB and target Chinese buyers.
    
- Many shops are **factories or small wholesalers** who only sell inside China.
    
- Most sellers don’t speak English and don’t know anything about export, customs or Amazon standards.
    

So 1688 is great for:

- Getting a **realistic idea of local prices**
    
- Finding more styles and suppliers than on Alibaba.com
    
- Sourcing simple products where you mainly care about price
    

But it is not designed for:

- Foreigners paying in USD/EUR
    
- Export packaging, labelling, compliance
    
- Hand-holding you through the import process
    

Knowing this helps you set the right expectations.

## 2. The four big obstacles for overseas buyers

If you try to use 1688 directly from outside China, you will usually run into four problems.

### 2.1 Language & communication

- The whole interface is Chinese.
    
- Product descriptions are often short, with a lot of assumptions.
    
- Suppliers reply quickly in Chinese slang and shorthand, not in textbook language.
    

Machine translation helps, but for specs, plating, materials, and packaging, half-understood messages can easily create expensive mistakes.

### 2.2 Payment in RMB

Most 1688 sellers accept:

- Alipay bound to a **Chinese ID**
    
- WeChat Pay
    
- RMB bank transfers
    

They usually do **not** accept:

- PayPal
    
- Wise
    
- International credit cards
    

This is the main reason many overseas buyers stop at the “add to cart and stare” stage.

### 2.3 Domestic shipping & consolidation

Even if you manage to pay:

- Each shop ships only within China, often to a local warehouse or address.
    
- If you order from 10 shops, you will get 10 separate parcels inside China.
    
- You still need someone to receive, check, repack and send out **one export shipment**.
    

Without someone on the ground, you either:

- Ship each parcel separately overseas (very expensive), or
    
- Hope a random forwarding warehouse does quality checks for you (usually they don’t).
    

### 2.4 Supplier risk & quality

1688 has gems and disasters mixed together:

- Some shops are real factories with strong capabilities.
    
- Some are middlemen reselling whatever they can find.
    
- Some have good ratings but poor consistency.
    

From abroad, it is hard to:

- Judge if photos are real or stolen
    
- See production scale
    
- Solve problems when something goes wrong

## 3. Your main options without a Chinese bank account

Let’s be direct: **you cannot “fully” use 1688 from overseas in the same way a Chinese buyer does.**  
But you have several workable options.

### Option 1 – Work with a trusted sourcing / 1688 agent in China

This is the model I use with my own clients.

How it works in practice:

1. You send your 1688 links and quantities.
    
2. I check suppliers, confirm real prices, and discuss details in Chinese.
    
3. I pay them in RMB, receive the goods in my office, check quality, and consolidate everything.
    
4. I ship one export parcel or shipment to you.
    

Pros:

- You don’t need RMB accounts or Chinese apps.
    
- You get **one clear invoice** in your currency.
    
- Someone in China is actually opening boxes and checking goods.
    
- It’s flexible: you can mix 1688 shops with factory orders I source directly.
    

Cons:

- You pay a **service fee/commission**. (In my case, usually 5–10% of goods value or a fixed fee for micro orders.)
    
- You need to choose an agent you really trust and who is transparent with pricing.
    

This is usually the best option for small buyers who value time and risk control.

### Option 2 – Use a “mystery” Taobao / 1688 forwarding agent

If you search online you’ll find many agents who:

- Give you a WhatsApp or WeChat
    
- Ask you to send links
    
- Send you a total price including everything in one line
    

Pros:

- Often very cheap on paper
    
- Fast quotes, low entry barrier
    

Cons (and I see this a lot):

- You rarely see **exact 1688 prices** or supplier names
    
- Hard to know if they changed products, downgraded quality, or switched suppliers
    
- Limited quality control – they ship what arrives
    
- If something goes wrong, you don’t know who is really responsible
    

This can work for extremely simple, low-risk items when you are comfortable with “whatever comes, comes”.  
But if you care about brand reputation, it is risky.

### Option 3 – Ask a friend / contact in China to help

Some buyers ask:

- A Chinese friend
    
- A student
    
- A random freelancer
    

to place 1688 orders for them.

Pros:

- Can be cheap or even free if it’s a favour
    
- Works for very small test orders
    

Cons:

- Your friend is not a sourcing professional
    
- They may not know how to evaluate suppliers or do inspections
    
- Mixing friendship and money can get awkward when something goes wrong
    

This is fine for **very small personal projects**, but once you treat it as a business, you probably need a more structured setup.

## 4. A practical workflow you can use (with an on-the-ground partner)

Let me share the basic workflow I use when overseas clients want to buy from 1688 without a Chinese bank account.  
You can follow the same steps with me or with any serious sourcing partner.

### Step 1 – Collect and clean your 1688 links

You:

- Save product links in a spreadsheet (Google Sheet works well)
    
- Add:
    
    - Rough quantity for each SKU
        
    - Color/size preferences
        
    - Any notes like “logo here”, “need better packaging”, “must be nickel-free”
        

Tip: Don’t chase 50 links at once. Start with 10–20 that you really like.

### Step 2 – Initial review and supplier check

I:

- Open each link, check:
    
    - Store rating and years active
        
    - Whether they are factory or trader (when visible)
        
    - Product photos vs. what I know from local markets
        
- Eliminate obviously risky shops (bad ratings, unrelated products, etc.)
    

Then we discuss:

- Which items are “must have” vs. “nice to have”
    
- Your target quality and budget level
    

### Step 3 – Confirm real prices and MOQs in Chinese

I contact the remaining suppliers and:

- Confirm real prices at your quantities
    
- Ask about:
    
    - Material and finish details
        
    - Packaging options
        
    - Lead times
        
    - Whether they accept custom logo or colour
        

I put everything into **one English quotation sheet** so you don’t have to read Chinese screenshots.

### Step 4 – Decide on samples vs. direct order

Together we decide:

- Which items you want to sample first
    
- Which items are simple enough to go straight into bulk
    

For samples:

- I have suppliers send them to my Yiwu office
    
- I check and photograph them side by side
    
- I ship samples to you in one parcel, so you only pay international freight once
    

### Step 5 – Agree on total cost and pay in your currency

When you are ready to place an order, I share a clear cost breakdown:

- Goods value for each item (based on 1688 prices)
    
- My service fee (percentage or fixed)
    
- Estimated domestic + international freight
    

You pay this total in USD/EUR via **PayPal, Wise, or bank transfer**.

I then:

- Pay each 1688 supplier in RMB
    
- Track their shipments into my office or warehouse
    

### Step 6 – Consolidate, check, and ship out

When goods arrive:

- We open boxes and do basic checks:
    
    - Correct items and quantities
        
    - Visual quality (obvious defects, wrong colours, damaged packing)
        
- We repack and consolidate:
    
    - One export shipment instead of many small parcels
        
    - Stronger cartons if needed
        

Finally, we:

- Book express / air / sea shipment based on the plan
    
- Prepare invoice and packing list in English
    
- Share tracking and keep an eye on transit until you receive everything

## 5. How to keep 1688 projects safe and transparent

No matter who you work with, I strongly recommend these principles:

1. **Always see the original 1688 prices.**
    
    - Ask for screenshots or a shared sheet with links.
        
    - Your agent’s service fee should be separated from the goods cost.
        
2. **Agree on responsibilities in writing.**
    
    - Who checks the goods? To what level?
        
    - What happens if there are defects or short shipment?
        
    - Is there any compensation or credit for next order?
        
3. **Start small and increase gradually.**
    
    - Use your first order to test not only the suppliers, but also your agent.
        
    - If communication and execution are smooth, then scale up.
        
4. **Don’t chase the lowest possible quote.**
    
    - If one offer is much cheaper than all others, something is usually missing:
        
        - material quality, plating thickness, packaging, or after-sales.

## 6. My personal view as someone in Yiwu

I like 1688. It gives me a very quick, realistic view of what is possible in China for a certain price.

But I don’t think 1688 is a magic solution for every small buyer.  
It’s a powerful tool **when combined with a local person who can filter, communicate, and check**.

If you try to handle everything alone from overseas, you might save some service fees, but you will pay in:

- time,
    
- stress,
    
- and sometimes, painful mistakes.
    

If you’d like someone on the ground to help you use 1688 safely, my typical process is simple:

1. You send me your 1688 links and target quantities.
    
2. I review suppliers, confirm details, and share a transparent quotation.
    
3. You pay in your currency; I handle RMB payments, consolidation, inspection and export.
    
4. You receive one shipment and one clear invoice.
    

Whether you work with me or someone else, I hope this guide gives you a clearer picture of **how to buy from 1688 without a Chinese bank account – and without gambling your budget.**
